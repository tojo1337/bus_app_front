                        With the growth of industrial activities in Durgapur, Government of West Bengal decided to provide an economic, adequate and efficient road transport service to the people of Durgapur industrial township complex. With the avowed objectives, the Government started a state transport service on 1st August 1963 with a fleet of 8 buses as a Departmental Undertaking under the direct control of its Home Department. Initially, transport services were operated only in the township covering a total route length of 65 kms. In 1964-65, the fleet strength increased to 25 with a total operating route length of 102 kms.
